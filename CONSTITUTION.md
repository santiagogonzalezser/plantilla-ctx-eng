# CONSTITUTION

- Use TDD (Test Driven Development).
- All tests must be created under app/tests/.
- Follow Atomic Design: atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages.
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- Every feature folder must include:
  - INITIAL.md (prompt)
  - PRP.md (detailed plan/spec)
  - RESULT.md (summary in bullet points)
- After completing a feature:
  - Update RESULT.md
  - Update FILETREE.md
  - Generate or update tests in app/tests/
- Always check the latest feature’s RESULT.md before starting new work.

# RESULT
- Summary of what was implemented
- Files created or modified
- Tests created in app/tests/
- Any notes or constraints
